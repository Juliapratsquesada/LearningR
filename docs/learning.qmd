## Basics of R

```{r}
1 + 1
```
## Setup code chunk

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
post_meal_data <- read_csv2(
  here::here("data/post-meal-insulin.csv")
)

```

#csv reads data separated by ","
#csv2 reads data separated by ";"

## Showing the data 

```{r}
post_meal_data
```

# A nicer way of looking at the data is (according to Luke): 

```{r}
glimpse(post_meal_data)

```
